# Pomodoro Timer üçÖ ‚è∞
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that alternates between pomodoros (work sessions) and breaks to increase focus and decrease mental exhaustion. A pomodoro is typically 25 minutes, followed by a short break of 5 minutes or a long break of 15 minutes for every four pomodoros. [Read](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) more about this technique.

## ‚ú® Features
* **Start/resume**, **pause**, or **restart** timer
* **Skip round** to move on to the next session/break. If the **timer is currently running, then a dialog pops up** to confirm the user's decision. Skipping the round counts toward the number of pomodoros. 
* **Directly choose a pomodoro, short break, or long break round.** If the **timer is currently running, then a dialog pops up** to confirm the user's decision. This action does not count toward the number of pomodoros.
* **Alarm sound** when timer is complete. When a round finishes, the next round is **automatically displayed**.
* **Displays pomodoro counter** and the **current task** to work on (defaults to first uncompleted task in list)
* **Add a task**, including its description and the estimated number of pomodoros needed to complete the task
* **Displays list of tasks** with the ability to **delete**, **edit name**, or **edit number of pomodoros** for a selected task. 
* **Indicate completion** for a task (completed tasks are crossed off)
